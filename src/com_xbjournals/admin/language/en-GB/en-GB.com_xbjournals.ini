XBJOURNALS_ABOUT_INFO="xbJournals will read and display CalDAV Journals and Notebooks on a Joomla site. It does not deal with Events or Tasks (ToDOs). 
<br />A Journal consistsof all of the VJOURNAL entries in a CalDAV calendar that have a start date  (DTSTART) assigned. 
<br />A Notebook contains all of the VJOURNAL entries in the calendar which do not have a start (or end) date. 
(Notes still have created and modified dates which can be used for sorting, but they are not tied to a specific vCalendar date). 
See the Roadmap forplanned enhancements"

XBJOURNALS_SIMPLECALDAV="SimpleCALDav PHP Library"
XBJOURNALS_SIMPLECALDAV_DESC="SimpleCALDav by Micheal Palm <palm.michael@gmx.de> is a php library developed from AgenDAV caldav-client-v2.php by Jorge Lopez Perez <jorge@adobo.org> which
again is heavily based on DAViCal caldav-client-v2.php by Andrew McMillan <andrew@mcmillan.net.nz>. I have simply stripped out most of the VEVENT and VTODO stuff, added some VJOURNAL functions
and made some adjustments to fit it into a Joomla framework. You can find SimpleCALDav at <a href='https://github.com/wvrzel/simpleCalDAV' target='_blank'>https://github.com/wvrzel/simpleCalDAV</a>
 on github, and my ammended version is in the source folder here <code>admin/helpers/xbcaldav</code>"
XBJOURNALS_JTXBOARD="jtxBoard"
XBJOURNALS_JTXBOARD_DESC="The genesis for this project was the discovery of the excellent <a href='https://github.com/TechbeeAT/jtxBoard' target='_blank'><b>jtxBoard</b> App</a> for Android by Patrick Lang. 
It makes use of the VJOURNAL component of the VCALENDAR spec to provide a very useable Journal and Notes facility for Android devices which syncs with a CalDAVserver. 
I had long wanted a way of making diary (journal) entries and notes that could be stored on the cloud (my NextCloud server) and was delighted to find . 
jtxBoard also handles VTODOs (Tasks) and is an excellent tool for keeping a journal or capturing notes sync'd across devices through a CalDaV calendar."
XBJOURNALS_PARSEDOWN="ParseDown"
XBJOURNALS_PARSEDOWN_DESC="I have started enabling Markdown text entry in some xbComponents where a full WYSIWYG editor (JCE is my preference) seems like overkill and takes up too much space as all that is needed
is very simple formatting and links. I use Parsedown by Emanuil Rusev (on <a href='https://github.com/erusev/parsedown' target='_blank'>github</a>) to convert the markdown to html for display. 
<br />jtxBoard allows the use of Markdown in journal entries without flagging it's presence (which is a mistake in my view but also useful) so I have included my slightly modified version of Parsedown with xbJournals
(find it in <code>admin/helpers/xbparsedown.php</code>) and it is used when displaying the Description fields.
<br />I haven't yet found a good wyswsyg editor for markdown in Joomla so you'll have to enter ardown codes manually"
XBJOURNALS_NEXTCLOUD="Nextcloud"
XBJOURNALS_NEXTCLOUD_DESC="In principle xbCalDAV should work with any CalDAV server (if you find problems raise them initially at <a href='https://github.com/rogercreagh/joomla-xbJournal/discussions/'target='_blank'>
xbJournals github discussions</a>) but I am only testing against my own Nextcloud sever (currently on v24.0.12)
<br /><b><i>IMPORTANT</i></b> - if you are using NextCloud for VJOURNAL in a calendar currently you have to manually add <code>VJOURNAL</code>to the <code>components</code> field in the row for the calendar you want to use in the 
<code>oc_calendars</code> table in the Nextcloud database. By default Nextcloud creates calendars with only VEVENT enabled, the NextCloud tasks app adds VTODO, but there is no Nextcloud Journals app, so the Nextcloud CalDAV server
will reject any attempt to write VJOURNAL coponents unless you manually enable them. The components field is a comma separated list so the full set looks like this <code>VEVENT,VTODO,VJOURNAL</code>. PhpMyAdmin will enable you to 
edit the field if you have it on your server."

XBJOURNALS_CATS_TAGS_MAPPING_LABEL="Mapping VJournal properties to Joomla Categories, Tags, State and Access fields"
XBJOURNALS_CATS_TAGS_MAPPING_DESC="Vjournal items have three properties that could be mapped to standard Joomla item fields Category, Tags, and Access
<br />STATUS and CLASS have a restricted range of single values with an item having only a single value (or none) - like Joomla Categories or Access.
<br />CATEGORIES in VJournal have a many-to-many relationship to items (ie an item can belong to multiple categories and vice versa) which make them like Joomla Tags. 
VJOURNAL Categories can take any text value.
<ul><li>STATUS is not required but the only allowed values are <code>Draft | Final | Cancelled</code> plus the implied 'not set'. 
<br />jtxBoard for Android uses an additional property X-STATUS to allow for a status with user defined values. This is particularly useful for Kanban task views (using VTODO).
<br />The Joomla category for VJOURNAL entries can be optionally set to use STATUS or X-STATUS values. If using X-STATUS then any other Joomla category value assigned to an item will be copied back to X-STATUS on sync.</li>
<li>CLASS can be <code>Private | Publc | Confidential</code>. Other values can be used. If no value is set it is to be treated as public. If a non-standard value is used other
apps should treat it as Public if they do not recognise it,but should preserve the value. xbJournal can map Public to public access, Private to Registered, and Confidential to Special.</li>
<li>CATEGORIES can be mapped to Joomla Tags. If mapping is enabled then a parent tag for all VJOURNAL categories can be chosen. This allows a form of separation between tags used by Journal entries
and general tags used throught the website (the Vjournal tags can still be selected for other component items and vice versa. Any new tags assigned to journal entries in xbJournal willbe copied back to the
server on sync. If a parent tag is assigned then only tags that are children of the parent tag willbe copied back on sync, thus limiting the creation of arbitary new categoies on the CalDAV server.</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
In xbJournals you can choose to map Vjournal Categories to Joomla Tags, to map VJournal Status to Joomla Category,and to map Vjournal Class to Access using the options below."
