1. About

simpleCalDAV is a php library that allows you to connect to a calDAV-server to get event-, todo- and free/busy-calendar resources from the server, to change them, to delete them, to create new ones, etc.
simpleCalDAV was made and tested for connections to the CalDAV-server Baikal 0.2.7. But it should work with any other CalDAV-server too.

It contains the following functions:
  - connect()
  - findCalendars()
  - setCalendar()
  - create()
  - change()
  - delete()
  - getEvents()
  - getVjournals() - added RCO - gets journals and notes
  - getJournals() - added RCO - gets only journals (DTSTART is set)
  - getNotes() - added RCO - gets only Notes (no DTSTART)
  - getTODOs()
  - getCustomReport()

All of those functions are really easy to use, self-explanatory and are deliverd with a big innitial comment, which explains all needed arguments and the return values.

This library is heavily based on AgenDAV caldav-client-v2.php by Jorge López Pérez <jorge@adobo.org> which again is heavily based on DAViCal caldav-client-v2.php by Andrew McMillan <andrew@mcmillan.net.nz>.
Actually, I hardly added any features. The main point of my work is to make everything straight forward and easy to use. You can use simpleCalDAV whithout a deeper understanding of the calDAV-protocol.


2. Requirements

Requirements of this library are
  - The php extension cURL ( http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php )


3. Installation

Just navigate into a directory on your server and execute
git clone https://github.com/wvrzel/simpleCalDAV.git

Assure yourself that cURL is installed.

Import xbVjournalHelper.php in your code and you are ready to go ;-)
